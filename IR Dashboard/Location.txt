Option 1: Power Automate (Recommended for Microsoft 365 users)
Power Automate allows you to create flows that run on a schedule and upload files to SharePoint.
Steps:

Go to Power Automate.
Click Create > Scheduled cloud flow.
Set the schedule (e.g., daily at 8 AM).
Add a trigger: Recurrence.
Add an action: Get file content (from OneDrive, local folder via gateway, etc.).
Add another action: Create file in SharePoint.

Site Address: Your SharePoint site
Folder Path: Target document library
File Name: Name of the file
File Content: From previous step



You can also use Power Automate Desktop if the file is stored locally and needs to be uploaded via a gateway.
